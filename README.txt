TextGames

This project is basically ports of existing text based games to non-OS devices.
Usually these devices has limited memory so some development will be done to 
avoid costly standard libraries and to include compression etc.

Since each game has its own origin the license will be per source file and not 
for the whole project. Licence for newly added sources is BSD-3
